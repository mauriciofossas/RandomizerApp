# RandomizerApp
Randomizer app. Users may choose to "roll dice", with any number of dice and any number of faces on the dice. The statistics
on the rolls are persistent (as long as the app is running), and the user can see the highest, lowest, and average roll (until
they clear the information or restart the app). Users may also enter their own things to randomize (i.e. restaurants, movies,
etc.) and get a randomly chosen one from the inputed items.

Main objective of this project is to learn how actvities and fragments work for android apps, and being able to send and
receive data from different fragments and activities and data from the user.
